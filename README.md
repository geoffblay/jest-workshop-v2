## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Next.js with Jest

Next.js has great documentation on how to get started with Jest testing [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/testing/jest).

If you aren't using Next.js for your project, additional Jest configurations can be found [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/next/getting-started#additional-configuration).

## Jest Basics

Since Next.js outlines much of the Jest setup and boilerplate for us, we reccommend skipping to the [Using Matchers](https://jestjs.io/docs/using-matchers) section of the Jest documentation. 

## Running Your Tests

Tests can be run in this repo using:

```bash
npm run test
```
